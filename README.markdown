cakephp-git-browser
===================

Couldn't find a git browser I like, so want to make my own. Since thechaw.com includes one and uses cakephp, which is what I also use, I used that as a starting point.

The plan is to create a fully functional separate plugin, that can be dropped into any cakephp project. Not sure about the styling for now, plobably will provide some minimalistic default views.

Original author of Chaw (at least this plugin) is Garrett J. Woodworth (gwoohoo@gmail.com)
